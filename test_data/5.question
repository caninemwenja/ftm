State bernoulli's principle
The faster a liquid or gas moves the less pressure it exerts
Increase in a liquid's or gas's velocity leads to a decrease in it's pressure.
----
A liquid or gas exerts less pressure when it moves faster::True
A liquid or gas exerts less pressure when it moves slower::False
Decrease in a liquid's or gas's velocity leads to an increase in it's pressure::True
Decrease in a liquid's or gas's velocity leads to an decrease in it's pressure::False
